GNOME 
======
## prerequisites
Before doing anything, we need to install the essential GNOME packages. Therefore, install ```gnome-tweaks``` with the package manager of your distribution (here we are working on Arch Linux) so:
```
sudo pacman -S gnome-tweaks
```
Then you have to install ```extension-manager``` from aur so:
```
yay -S extension-manager
```
After this, update the system once ``` sudo pacman -Syu ``` and then enter the [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) website and install the following plugins:
## Plugins
+ App Icons Taskbar
+ Blur my Shell
+ Clipboard Indicator
+ Dash to Dock
+ GSConnect
+ Iranian Persian Calender
+ Logo Menu
+ Quick Setting Tweaker
+ RunCat
+ Top Bar Organizer

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).
